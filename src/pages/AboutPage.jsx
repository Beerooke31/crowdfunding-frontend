      <h1>Starbounty - Choose Your Own Adventure </h1>
      <p>
        Starbounty is a crowdfunding platform designed to assist researchers and
        fans of the occult in their quest to learn more about the mysteries of
        the universe. If you've ever wondered, "Is that old rundown house across
        the street haunted or just spooky because it's an abandoned meth lab?"
        Or, "Why do I keep having flashbacks of being probed by a grey
        android-like figure in a brightly lit space?" Then this is the site for
        you. Create your own research project or find one to fund! You're
        Indiana Jones and we're the path to the Temple of Doom (please don't sue
        us Disney).{" "}
